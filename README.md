# Tic-Tac-Toe

### [Live Demo](https://arito7.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

- [x] Build the logic that checks for when the game is over! Should check for 3-in-a-row and a tie.
- [x] Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that congratulates the winning player!
- [x] Optional - If you’re feeling ambitious create an AI so that a player can play against the computer!
Start by just getting the computer to make a random legal move.
Once you’ve gotten that, work on making the computer smart. It is possible to create an unbeatable AI using the minimax algorithm (read about it here, some googling will help you out with this one)
- [ ] Refine UI
